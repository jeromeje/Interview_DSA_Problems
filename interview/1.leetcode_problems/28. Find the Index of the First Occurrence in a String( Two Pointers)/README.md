# Answer:
> 1. find first =0 and last elements =len of target string  by their by index
> 2. for loop iterates len of the target element and search in the main array. loop => (0, len(string)-len(target)+1)
> 3. eg: leetcode, target= co, iteration is target len =2.  =>  le ,ee, tc,co. return c th index 
> 4.  by increasing the order one in both and check the condition.
> 5.  note:
```
loop => (0, len(string)-len(target)+1)
```
